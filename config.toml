As a result, analytical workload requirements shifted from relational to polyglot queries involving user-defined functions (UDFs). Although some data processing systems support polyglot queries, they often embed third-party language runtimes. This embedding induces a high performance overhead, as it causes additional data materialization between execution engines. In this paper, we present Babelfish, a novel data processing engine designed for polyglot queries. Babelfish introduces an intermediate representation that unifies queries from different implementation languages. This enables new, holistic optimizations across operator and language boundaries, e.g., operator fusion and workload specialization. As a result, Babelfish avoids data transfers and enables efficient utilization of hardware resources. Our evaluation shows that Babelfish outperforms state-of-the-art data processing systems by up to one order of magnitude and reaches the performance of handwritten code. With Babelfish, we bridge the performance gap between relational and multi-language UDFs and lay the foundation for the efficient execution of future polyglot workloads."

However, each technique operates under different assumptions with respect to workload characteristics such as properties of aggregation functions (e.g., invertible, associative), window types (e.g., sliding, sessions), windowing measures (e.g., time- or count-based), and stream (dis)order. In this paper, we present Scotty, an efficient and general opensource operator for sliding-window aggregation in stream processing systems, such as Apache Flink, Apache Beam, Apache Samza, Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, and Apache Storm. One can easily extend Scotty with user-defined aggregation functions and window types. Scotty implements the concept of general stream slicing and derives workload characteristics from aggregation queries to improve performance without sacrificing its general applicability. We provide an in-depth view on the algorithms of the general stream slicing approach. Our experiments show that Scotty outperforms alternative solutions by up to one order of magnitude."

Modern edge devices contribute to query processing by leveraging accelerated processing units with multicore CPUs or GPUs. Therefore, data processing in the IoT presents the challenges of 1) minimizing the energy consumed while sustaining a given query throughput, and 2) processing increasingly complex queries within a given energy budget. In this paper, we investigate how modern edge devices can reduce the energy requirements of stream joins as a common data processing operation. We explore three dimensions to save energy: workload characteristics, computational efficiency, and heterogeneous hardware. Based on our findings, we propose the ecoJoin that 1) reduces energy consumption by 81% at a given join throughput, and 2) enables scaling the throughput by two orders-of-magnitude within a given energy budget."

For each approach, there are further design aspects to consider, including different join methods and partitioning schemes, leading to a large design space. Our results show that none of the algorithms always performs the best, and the choice of the most performant algorithm depends on: (i) workload characteristics, (ii) application requirements, and (iii) hardware architectures.

Therefore, little investment is made in systematic acquisition, integration, and pre-processing of data. This lack of infrastructure results in redundant manual effort and computation. Furthermore, central data consolidation is not always technically or economically desirable or even feasible (e.g., due to privacy, and/or data ownership). The ExDRa system aims to provide system infrastructure for this exploratory data science process on federated and heterogeneous, raw data sources. Technical focus areas include (1) ad-hoc and federated data integration on raw data, (2) data organization and reuse of intermediates, and (3) optimization of the data science lifecycle, under awareness of partially accessible data. In this paper, we describe use cases, the overall system architecture, selected features of SystemDS' new federated backend (for federated linear algebra programs, federated parameter servers, and federated data preparation), as well as promising initial results. Beyond existing work on federated learning, ExDRa focuses on enterprise federated ML and related data pre-processing challenges. In this context, federated ML has the potential to create a more fine-grained spectrum of data ownership and thus, even new markets."

Modern stream processing engines (SPEs) provide complex window types and user-defined aggregation functions to analyze streams. While SPEs run in central data centers, wireless sensors networks (WSNs) perform distributed aggregations close to the data sources, which is beneficial especially in modern IoT setups. However, WSNs support only basic aggregations and windows. To bridge the gap between complex central aggregations and simple distributed analysis, we propose Disco, a distributed complex window aggregation approach. Disco processes complex window types on multiple independent nodes while efficiently aggregating incoming data streams. Our evaluation shows that Disco’s throughput scales linearly with the number of nodes and that Disco already outperforms a centralized solution in a two-node setup. Furthermore, Disco reduces the network cost significantly compared to the centralized approach. Disco’s tree-like topology handles thousands of nodes per level and scales to support future data-intensive streaming applications."

                abstract = "Window aggregation is a core operation in data stream processing. Existing aggregation techniques focus on reducing latency, eliminating redundant computations, and minimizing memory usage. However, each technique operates under different assumptions with respect to workload characteristics such as properties of aggregation functions (e.g., invertible, associative), window types (e.g., sliding, sessions), windowing measures (e.g., time- or countbased), and stream (dis)order. Violating the assumptions of a technique can deem it unusable or drastically reduce its performance. In this paper, we present the first general stream slicing technique for window aggregation. General stream slicing automatically adapts to workload characteristics to improve performance without sacrificing its general applicability. As a prerequisite, we identify workload characteristics which affect the performance and applicability of aggregation techniques. Our experiments show that general stream slicing outperforms alternative concepts by up to one order of magnitude."

                abstract = "The efficient processing of video streams is a key component in many emerging Internet of Things (IoT) and edge applications, such as Virtual and Augmented Reality (V/AR) and self-driving cars. These applications require real-time high-throughput video processing. This can be attained via a collaborative processing model between the edge and the cloud---called an Edge-Cloud model. To this end, many approaches were proposed to optimize the latency and bandwidth consumption of Edge-Cloud video processing, especially for Neural Networks (NN)-based methods. In this demonstration. We investigate the efficiency of these NN techniques, how they can be combined, and whether combining them leads to better performance. Our demonstration invites participants to experiment with the various NN techniques, combine them, and observe how the underlying NN changes with different techniques and how these changes affect accuracy, latency and bandwidth consumption."

These concept drifts cause wrong predictions and lead to incorrect business decisions. Concept drift detection methods such as adaptive windowing (Adwin) allow for adapting to concept drifts on the fly. In this paper, we examine Adwin in detail and point out its throughput bottlenecks. We then introduce several parallelization alternatives to address these bottlenecks. Our optimizations lead to a speedup of two orders of magnitude over the original Adwin implementation. Thus, we explore parallel adaptive windowing to provide scalable concept detection for high-velocity data streams with millions of tuples per second."

                abstract = "Computing aggregates over windows is at the core of virtually every stream processing job. Typical stream processing applications involve overlapping windows and, therefore, cause redundant computations. Several techniques prevent this redundancy by sharing partial aggregates among windows. However, these techniques do not support out-of-order processing and session windows. Out-of-order processing is a key requirement to deal with delayed tuples in case of source failures such as temporary sensor outages. Session windows are widely used to separate different periods of user activity from each other. In this paper, we present Scotty, a high throughput operator for window discretization and aggregation. Scotty splits streams into non-overlapping slices and computes partial aggregates per slice. These partial aggregates are shared among all concurrent queries with arbitrary combinations of tumbling, sliding, and session windows. Scotty introduces the first slicing technique which (1) enables stream slicing for session windows in addition to tumbling and sliding windows and (2) processes out-of-order tuples efficiently. Our technique is generally applicable to a broad group of dataflow systems which use a unified batch and stream processing model. Our experiments show that we achieve a throughput an order of magnitude higher than alternative stateof-the-art solutions."

Developers need insights from the data to define meaningful analysis flows, which often makes the development a trial and error process. Data visualization techniques can provide insights to aid the development, but the sheer amount of available data frequently makes it impossible to visualize all data points at the same time. We present I2, an interactive development environment that coordinates running cluster applications and corresponding visualizations such that only the currently depicted data points are processed and transferred. To this end, we present an algorithm for the real-time visualization of time series, which is proven to be correct and minimal in terms of transferred data. Moreover, we show how cluster programs can adapt to changed visualization properties at runtime to allow interactive data exploration on data streams."
